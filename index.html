                 A newspaper is a serial publication which contains news on current events of special or general interest. The
                  individual parts are listed chronologically or numerically and appear frequently, usually at least once 
                  a week 
                  but sometimes fortnightly or monthly.

                Traditionally newspapers are printed on newsprint paper, usually appear without a cover, 
                folded rather than bound together, with a masthead, and are normally larger than 297 mm x 420 mm 
                in size. They may include supplements such as colour magazines, or other inserts for
                 special features or events. [1][2]
                
                With the advent of digital publishing, digital newspapers are being produced, 
                and are increasingly popular while readership of print newspapers is generally in decline [3]
                . A digital newspaper is a newspaper created digitally (i.e. born digital) and available online
                 via the Internet. [4] Digital newspapers may be accessed as apps on mobile devices. 
                 Digital newspapers are often in the form of integrating resources, with new material integrated 
                 into the resource and older content being removed; or they may be serial publications. </p1>
