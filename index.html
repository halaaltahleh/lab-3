            A newspaper is a serial publication which contains news on current events of special or general interest.
            The individual parts are listed chronologically or numerically and appear frequently, usually at least once
            a week but sometimes fortnightly or monthly.

        <p>Traditionally newspapers are printed on newsprint paper, usually appear without a cover,
            folded rather than bound together, with a masthead, and are normally larger than 297 mm x 420 mm
            in size. They may include supplements such as colour magazines, or other inserts for
            special features or events.
