                 A newspaper is a serial publication which contains news on current events of special or general interest. The
                  individual parts are listed chronologically or numerically and appear frequently, usually at least once 
                  a week 
                  but sometimes fortnightly or monthly.

                Traditionally newspapers are printed on newsprint paper, usually appear without a cover, 
                folded rather than bound together, with a masthead, and are normally larger than 297 mm x 420 mm 
                in size. They may include supplements such as colour magazines, or other inserts for
                 special features or events.
